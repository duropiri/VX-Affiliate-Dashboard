# Password Reset Feature

## Overview

The password reset feature allows users to reset their password via email when they forget their login credentials. The feature is now fully functional and includes proper error handling and user feedback.

## How It Works

### 1. Request Password Reset
- Users click "Forgot Password?" on the auth page
- They enter their email address
- A password reset email is sent to their email address
- The email contains a secure link with reset tokens

### 2. Password Reset Flow
- Users click the link in their email
- They are redirected to `/auth/reset-password`
- The page validates the reset tokens from the URL
- Users enter and confirm their new password
- The password is updated in Supabase
- Users are redirected back to the auth page

## Files Modified/Created

### New Files
- `app/(auth)/auth/reset-password/page.tsx` - Password reset page that handles the reset flow

### Modified Files
- `lib/auth.ts` - Updated `resetPassword` function to redirect to the correct reset page
- `app/(auth)/auth/page.tsx` - Fixed bugs in the password reset form

## Technical Details

### Reset Page Features
- **Token Validation**: Validates access_token, refresh_token, and type parameters
- **Session Management**: Sets up Supabase session with reset tokens
- **Password Validation**: Ensures passwords match and meet minimum requirements
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling for invalid links and failed updates
- **User Feedback**: Toast notifications and clear success/error states
- **Security**: Proper session cleanup and redirect handling

### Security Considerations
- Reset tokens are single-use and time-limited
- Passwords must be at least 6 characters long
- Invalid or expired links show appropriate error messages
- Session is properly managed during the reset process

## Usage

### For Users
1. Go to the auth page (`/auth`)
2. Click "Forgot Password?"
3. Enter your email address
4. Check your email for the reset link
5. Click the link in the email
6. Enter and confirm your new password
7. Sign in with your new password

### For Developers
The password reset flow is handled automatically by Supabase. The main functions are:

```typescript
// Send reset email
await resetPassword(email);

// Update password (handled in reset page)
await supabase.auth.updateUser({ password: newPassword });
```

## Error Handling

The system handles various error scenarios:
- Invalid or expired reset links
- Network errors during password update
- Password validation failures
- Missing or invalid tokens

All errors are displayed to the user with clear messaging and appropriate actions.

## Testing

To test the password reset feature:
1. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
2. Go to `/auth`
3. Click "Forgot Password?"
4. Enter a valid email address
5. Check the email for the reset link
6. Follow the reset flow

Note: In development, you may need to configure your Supabase project to allow password resets and set up proper email templates.
